## Jungle Jumper Proposal

### Background

Jungle Jumper is a 2D jump to live game that, not surprisingly, takes place in a Jungle.

### Functionality & MVP

With this Conway's Game of Life simulator, users will be able to:

- [ ] Pause the game
- [ ] Jump to avoid plunging to their death
- [ ] Make contact with bananas to stay alive


In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] A modal that describes the epic mission the monkey will embark (getting bananas). 
- [ ] A production README

### Wireframes

This app will consist of a single screen with game board, game controls, and nav links to the Github, my LinkedIn,
and the About modal.  Game controls will include pause.


### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- `JavaScript` for game logic
-  `HTML` Canvas elements for effects
- `Webpack` to bundle js files.


### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**:  -- Learning --
  Goals for the day:

- Learn how to employ the functionality of vanilla Javascript in a gaming context
- Learn the basics of incorporating my images

**Day 2**: -- Implementing Functionality --
  Goals for the day:

- Build out the functionality of a moving screen
- Build out the functionality of the main monkey (jumping, dying)
- Build out the functionality for the horizontal tree branches it will use

**Day 3**: -- Implementing Design --
  Goals for the day:

- Find out how to replace my block with the monkey with an image
- Find out how to replace my straight lines with branches
- Find out how to replace the backgroudn with a Jungle


### Bonus features

There are many directions this cellular automata engine could eventually go.  Some anticipated updates are:

- [ ] Make the background Parallax (may have to incorporate a library)
- [ ] Incorporate cute chimp noises when the monkey jumps
